## Unit 4 Project for the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree

Extra credit features: 
* Added keyboard functionality to allow players to use computer keyboard to enter guesses
* Changed font style
* Style changes to buttons:
    * Added box shadow to start button and keys 
    * Added color change and animation to start button when clicked
* Used setInterval() method to make game over message blink
    * https://www.delftstack.com/howto/javascript/javascript-blinking-text/ - used this example as a guide, which toggles
      between the element's display state. In my case, I toggled between the message's visibility state.
